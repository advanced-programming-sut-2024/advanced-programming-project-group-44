# Gwent Game Replication

A graphical replication of the Gwent card game implemented in Java.

## Overview
This project involved creating a fully functional Gwent game with both server-client architecture and a graphical user interface. The game logic, organization of elements, and GUI were all implemented in Java using JavaFX. Developed collaboratively, the project strengthened programming skills and teamwork.

## Features
- **Game Logic** – Complete implementation of Gwent rules and card interactions.  
- **Server-Client Architecture** – Enables multiplayer gameplay across a network.  
- **Graphical User Interface** – Built with JavaFX for interactive and visually appealing gameplay.  
- **Team Development** – Project completed collaboratively, enhancing coding, design, and teamwork skills.

## Purpose
Designed as an advanced programming course project, the goal was to apply object-oriented programming principles, GUI development, and network communication to build a complex interactive application.
